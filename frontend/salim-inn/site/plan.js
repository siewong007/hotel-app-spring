// Site plan traced from a Google Earth top-down capture of the Farley
// Commercial Centre, Lorong Salim 17, Sibu (2°15'59"N 111°51'47"E).
//
// SCALE: the capture's own scale bar measured 320.5 px for 40 m, so
// 1 aerial pixel = 0.12481 m. Every figure below is metres.
//
// ORIGIN: the Salim Inn map pin. +x is east, +z is south — the same handedness
// as the aerial, so image coordinates convert straight across and three.js
// consumes them as (x, z) with y up.
//
// This replaces a trace of a Google *road map* at a different zoom, which put
// the neighbouring blocks in roughly the right relationship to each other but
// in the wrong place relative to the two buildings that matter.

// the Hometown Pharmacy end, then sharply inward immediately past Salim Inn,
// which is what closes the north side of the block.
